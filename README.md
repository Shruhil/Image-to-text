# Image-to-text

# Overview
This repository contains code examples and explanations for using Pytesseract, a Python wrapper for Tesseract-OCR Engine, to extract text from images. Tesseract is an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool developed by Google, capable of recognizing text in various image formats.

# What is Tesseract?
Tesseract is an OCR tool that supports UTF-8 and can recognize text in over 100 languages. It provides output in formats such as plain text, HTML, PDF, TSV, and XML. The accuracy of text extraction depends significantly on the quality of the input image.

# How to Install Tesseract?
Download and Install: Download the relevant binary for your OS from Tesseract GitHub.
Add to PATH: Add the installation location to your system PATH.
Verify Installation: Type tesseract in the command line to verify installation.

# What is Pytesseract?
Pytesseract is a Python module that wraps around the Tesseract-OCR Engine, providing easy integration with Python applications for text extraction from images.

* How to Install Pytesseract?
Install via pip: Run pip install pytesseract in your terminal or command prompt.
Verify Installation: Open Python shell and import pytesseract (import pytesseract) to check installation status.

# Why this Project
Importance of Image Text Extraction
Image text extraction using OCR tools like Tesseract and Pytesseract serves several important purposes:

* Automation: Automates the extraction of text from images, saving time and effort in manual data entry tasks.

* Data Accessibility: Converts scanned documents, images, or screenshots into editable and searchable text formats.

* Enhanced Analysis: Enables text mining and analysis on image data, facilitating deeper insights and decision-making.
